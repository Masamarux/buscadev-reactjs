## Description

By writing a github's username, you will have a page with the user's infos and repositories.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* @apollo/client;
* bootstrap;
* graphql;
* react-bootstrap;
* react-icons;
* styled-components;
* and others react's dependencies;

### Installing and Executing

* To install all dependecies use:
```
yarn install
```
* You can start application by:
```
yarn start
```
* You can build application by:
```
yarn build
```
* You have to install a server for build:
```
yarn global add serve
```
* Then use:

```

## Help

If you try to search for enterprise or organization's profiles or user's profiles that have more than 100 repos you will get an error page, at the moment the application isn't ready for fetch those kind of data because of GraphQL Github api nature but this will be soon fixed.
